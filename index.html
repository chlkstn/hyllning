          <h2>Who is Hideo Kojima</h2>
          <p>
            Hideo Kojima (小島 秀夫, Kojima Hideo, born August 24, 1963) is a
            Japanese video game designer. He is regarded as an auteur of video
            games.[2] He developed a strong passion for film and literature
            during his childhood and adolescence. In 1986, he was hired by
            Konami, for which he designed and wrote Metal Gear (1987) for the
            MSX2, a game that laid the foundations for stealth games and the
            Metal Gear series, his best known and most appreciated works. At
            Konami, he also produced the Zone of the Enders series, as well as
            wrote and designed Snatcher (1988) and Policenauts (1994), graphic
            adventure games regarded for their cinematic presentation. Kojima
            founded Kojima Productions within Konami in 2005,[1][3] and he was
            appointed vice president of Konami Digital Entertainment in 2011.[4]
            Following his departure from Konami in 2015, he refounded Kojima
            Productions as an independent studio; his first game outside Konami,
            Death Stranding, was released in 2019.[5]
